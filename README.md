# Ians-Portfolio
A website that displays information about me
In this project, I created a portfolio webpage that displays information about myself and the projects I have been featured in.

In order to open this project, download the html titled "index.html", run it, and a webpage with my information should appear on your screen.

My CSS Stylesheet is also available in the repo, if you need to look at it or edit it.
